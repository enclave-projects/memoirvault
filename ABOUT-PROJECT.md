**Date:** Thursday, January 30, 2025, 2:45 PM IST

### 1. Project Overview

MemoirVault has evolved into a **comprehensive privacy-first memoir platform** that combines secure personal journaling with optional social sharing capabilities. The platform allows users to record their autobiographies in a private digital space while providing the option to share selected stories with a broader community of memoir writers.
