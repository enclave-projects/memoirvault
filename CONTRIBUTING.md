   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow our coding standards
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   # Test manually in the browser
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**

   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title
- **Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
- **Screenshots**: Include screenshots for UI changes
- **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes

## üìù Coding Standards

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style:

```bash
npm run lint        # Check for linting errors
npm run lint:fix    # Auto-fix linting errors
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use kebab-case for files (`user-profile.tsx`)
- **Components**: Use PascalCase (`UserProfile`)
- **Functions**: Use camelCase (`getUserProfile`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`)

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use proper type imports: `import type { User } from './types'`

### React Best Practices

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use proper key props in lists
- Follow React accessibility guidelines
- Use semantic HTML elements

### Database

- Use Drizzle ORM for all database operations
- Create proper migrations for schema changes
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Follow proper indexing practices

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test        # Run all tests
npm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Write integration tests for API routes
- Write component tests for React components
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Component/Function Name', () => {
  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Arrange
    const input = 'test input';
    
    // Act
    const result = functionToTest(input);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe('expected output');
  });
});
```
